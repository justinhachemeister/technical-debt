### Testing

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Even _moderate_ testing is helpful
* Helps prevent regressions <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Refactor with confidence <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

- Even moderate tests can be worth its weight in gold
- Regression testing
- Ensure existing functionality isn't broken during a refactor
