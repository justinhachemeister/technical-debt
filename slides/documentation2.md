### Documentation

* Document not only _what_ something does, but _why_
* Documentation is only useful when it's accurate
	* Make docs part of code review! <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

- Only thing worse than no docs is bad docs
- Make updating relevant docs a required part of code review
    + Changed function signature but not the docs? That's a blocker.
