### Bus Factor <!-- .element: class="bus-factor-logo" -->

Note:

- How screwed a team would be if a given engineer were to be hit by a bus
    + ...or got sick, changed jobs, or was otherwise unavailable
- Shared knowledge reduces risk of the only person who understands something getting sick, bussed, or quitting
