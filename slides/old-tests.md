#### A word of caution:

* An outdated set of tests can be worse than having no tests at all! <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Test the functionality, not the implementation! <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Red - Green - Refactor <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

- Tests should reflect how the app *should* work
- Ensure they're useful by testing the functionality, not the implementation
    + We don't care *how* it works, only that it does what we're trying to do
