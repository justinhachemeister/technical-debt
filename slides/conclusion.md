- What have we learned today?
    + Tech debt is inevitable, but we can be aware of how much we're taking on
    + Ever vigilant, always watching for red flags in our projects.
    + Document not only how, but why; reduce bus factor
    + Writing tests, focused on result, not implementation
    + Cleaning up old functionality and ensuring new features can be removed easily
    + Resisting the urge to jump on every bandwagon
    + Being smart about how we handle application dependencies
