### Good and Bad technical debt

* Good: <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* Well documented + tested business logic <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Bad: <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* Exceptions, work-arounds, "hacks" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* "Black boxes" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
	* Spaghetti code <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:

- Just like personal finance, there's good and bad technical debt
- Good debt == stuff you and your team understand.
    - May not be perfect, but clear in its purpose and hopefully tested — the cost of doing business.
- Bad debt (examples to follow)
